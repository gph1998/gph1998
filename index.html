           <h1 ><u>What is ArthaShashtra?</u></h1>
           <div  class="text_style">The <b>Arthashastra (Sanskrit: अर्थशास्त्रम्, IAST: Arthaśāstram) </b>is an Ancient Indian Sanskrit treatise on statecraft, political science, 
               economic policy and military strategy. The Arthashastra explores issues of social welfare, the collective ethics that hold a society 
               together, advising the king that in times and in areas devastated by famine, epidemic and such acts of nature, or by war, he should 
               initiate public projects such as creating irrigation waterways and building forts around major strategic holdings and 
               towns and exempt taxes on those affected.[23] The text was influential on other Hindu texts that 
               followed, such as the sections on kings, governance and legal procedures included in Manusmriti</div>

               <div class="text_style">
                   <b>Artha</b> refers to the pursuit of worldly goods, personal success, stability, and social status. These supposed early arthashastras, therefore, could have dealt with any number of subjects along these lines, quite possibly 
                   including politics, but there is no reason to conclude that the extant work is simply a revision of older pieces.

                    <li class="text_style">It was known through later references to it in other pieces but was considered lost until a later copy was discovered in 1905 CE by the Sanskrit scholar Rudrapatna Shamasastry (l. 1868-1944 CE) which he published in 1909 CE and then translated into English in 1915 CE</li>
                    <li class="text_style">The Arthashastra has since enjoyed international fame as one of the greatest political treatises ever written and is frequently compared to The Prince (published 1532 CE) by the Italian political philosopher Niccolò Machiavelli (l. 1469-1527 CE) of Renaissance fame. </li>
                    <li class="text_style">The Arthashastra, composed some 1500 years before The Prince, is still studied in the present day for its rational presentation of statecraft and its effectiveness in arguing for the State as an organic entity served best by a strong leader whose most important duty and focus should be the good of the people.The concepts expressed in Arthashastra, at least in part, are thought to derive from older texts which were lost based on references to arthashastras (plural) in other works such as the <b>Mahabharata</b>.</li>
                    <li class="text_style">There is no scholarly consensus on this claim, however, because there is no way to compare the extant work with the supposed earlier versions. Further, as noted, Artha as a concept does not refer solely to politics, military strategy, economics, animal husbandry, marriage, or any of the other subjects addressed in the fifteen books of the Arthashastra</li>

           <div class="text_style">
               <b>Chanakya</b>, also called <b>Kautilya</b> or <b>Vishnugupta</b>, (flourished 300 BCE), Hindu statesman and philosopher who wrote a classic treatise on polity, Artha-shastra (“The Science of Material Gain”), a compilation of almost everything that had been written in India up to his time regarding artha (property, economics, or material success).

                He was born into a Brahman family and received his education at Taxila (now in Pakistan). He is known to have had a knowledge of medicine and astrology, and it is believed he was familiar with elements of Greek and Persian learning introduced into India by Zoroastrians. Some authorities believe he was a Zoroastrian or at least was strongly influenced by that religion. Chanakya became a counselor and adviser to Chandragupta (reigned c. 321–c. 297), founder of the Mauryan empire of northern India, but lived by himself. He was instrumental in helping Chandragupta overthrow the powerful Nanda dynasty at Pataliputra, in the Magadha region.

           <div class="text_style">
                Chanakya’s book came to be Chandragupta’s guide. Each of its 15 sections deals with a phase of government, which Chanakya sums up as “<i>the science of punishment</i>.” He openly advises the development of an elaborate spy system reaching into all levels of society and encourages political and secret assassination. Lost for centuries, the book was discovered in 1905.
           </div>

           <div class="text_style">
                Compared by many to Italian statesman and writer Niccolò Machiavelli and by others to <u>Aristotle and Plato</u>, Chanakya is alternately condemned for his ruthlessness and trickery and praised for his sound political wisdom and knowledge of human nature. All authorities agree, however, that it was mainly because of Chanakya that the Mauryan empire under Chandragupta and later under Ashoka (reigned c. 265–c. 238) became a model of efficient government

                He believes that "management" is a universal art that can be put to use in almost all fields and thus had explored the same through management courses in fields ranging from ‘Industrial development’, ‘Tourism’ and 'Youth in National development' and have finally got his management consultant cerificate from the international Institute of management Consultants, to spread the essence of 'management'.

                CHANAKYA—the original management guru of ancient India, has always intriuged him and thus began his journey of discovering the art and practising it. it led him to go an extensive management research course on 'kautilya's arthshastra'- the well known book on Management written in 3rd Century BC from 'Chinmaya International Foundation' (CIF), Kerala under the guidance of Dr Gangadharan Nair,the dean of Adi Shankara Samskrit University.
                Currently he is pursuing an MA in Sanskrit – the language in which the fundamentals of management science were coined ages ago, and also working towards a PhD in the subject.
